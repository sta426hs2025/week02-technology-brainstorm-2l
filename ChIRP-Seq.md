Short summary of ChIRP seq:

Chromatin isolation by RNA purification  (ChIRP) is a sequencing technique to study long noncoding RNAs, lncRNAs for short. Long noncoding RNAs can regulate the chromatin state by interacting with the DNA and forming hybrid structures, altering the DNA's accessibility. LncRNAs can also recruit chromatin modifiers that then modify histones or chromatin structure, which can lead to silencing or activation of genes.

ChIRP is a method that enables the unspecific discovery of RNA-bound DNA and proteins. This is achieved by cross-linking the cells in vivo, which fixes the RNAs, DNA and proteins in place. The cells' chromatin is then extracted and homogenized and the probes, biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides, are added. These probes are designed to hybridize to the target lncRNA of interest, allowing the lncRNA, and the DNA and proteins bound to it, to be isolated using magnetic beads. The bound DNA can then be sequenced and the proteins can be analyzed to study where in the genome the long noncoding RNAs are binding and what proteins they interact with.
